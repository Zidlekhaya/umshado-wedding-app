- **Task Management**: Organize wedding planning tasks with priorities and deadlines
- **Vendor Management**: Keep track of wedding vendors and their details

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI
- Supabase account (for backend services)

## Environment Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Supabase credentials:

   ```bash
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
   ```

2. Get your Supabase credentials:
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Create a new project or use an existing one
   - Go to Settings > API
   - Copy the Project URL and anon public key

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up your environment variables (see Environment Setup above)

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
